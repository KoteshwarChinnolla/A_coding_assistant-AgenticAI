### Problem Statement

Develop a function that appends the content of a given string to a Markdown file named `test_output.md`. The function should ensure that the content is prefixed with a header "## Final Code" and appended to the file with UTF-8 encoding. The function should handle file operations efficiently without overwriting the existing content in the file.

**Requirements:**
1. The function should take a single string parameter, which represents the content to be written to the file.
2. The content should be appended to the end of the file `test_output.md`.
3. Each addition should be preceded by the header "## Final Code" to clearly delineate sections within the file.
4. The function must ensure that the file is opened with UTF-8 encoding to support a wide range of characters.

**Example:**
Given the string `response.content = "print('Hello, world!')"` and an empty file `test_output.md`, after calling the function, the content of `test_output.md` should be:

```
## Final Code
print('Hello, world!')
```
## test_cases 

Here are the test cases for the problem statement described:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - input: `response.content = "print('Hello, world!')"`
   - output: 
     ```
     ## Final Code
     print('Hello, world!')
     ```
   - explanation: This is a basic test to ensure the function writes a simple string with a header to the file when the file is initially empty.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - input: `response.content = "def greet(name):\\n    return f'Hello, {name}!'"`
   - output: 
     ```
     ## Final Code
     def greet(name):
         return f'Hello, {name}!'
     ```
   - explanation: This test case checks if the function can handle multi-line strings properly, ensuring that the content is correctly formatted and appended to the file.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - input: `response.content = "print('¡Hola, mundo!')"`
   - output: 
     ```
     ## Final Code
     print('¡Hola, mundo!')
     ```
   - explanation: This test case ensures that the function can handle UTF-8 encoded characters, ensuring that non-English text is written correctly to the file.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - input: `response.content = "import os\\nprint(os.getcwd())"`
   - output: 
     ```
     ## Final Code
     import os
     print(os.getcwd())
     ```
   - explanation: This test case uses a string containing a Python import statement followed by a function call. It checks the function's ability to handle strings with multiple lines and different types of Python code.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - input: `response.content = "for i in range(10):\\n    print(i)"`
   - output: 
     ```
     ## Final Code
     for i in range(10):
         print(i)
     ```
   - explanation: This test case includes a for-loop in the string input to check how the function handles Python code with indented blocks. The goal is to verify that the function can correctly append a block of code to the file, preserving the indentation and structure.

### File Writing Operation
This section describes the process of appending content to a markdown file using Python.

```python
with open("test_output.md", "a", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    file.write("## Final Code \n\n" + response.content + "\n")
```

## Final Code 

```python
# This section describes the process of appending content to a markdown file using Python.
# It involves opening a file in append mode and writing formatted content to it.

with open("test_output.md", "a", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    # Appends "## Final Code" followed by the content of the response to the file.
    # The content is assumed to come from a response object, which is not defined here.
    file.write("## Final Code \n\n" + response.content + "\n")
``` 

This block of code opens a file named `test_output.md` in append mode (`"a"`), ensuring it doesn't overwrite the existing content. It then writes a formatted string to the file, which includes a markdown header "## Final Code" followed by the content of a response object. The encoding is set to "utf-8" to support a wide range of characters.
