## Final Code 

```python
# This section describes the process of appending content to a markdown file using Python.
# It involves opening a file in append mode and writing formatted content to it.

with open("test_output.md", "a", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    # Appends "## Final Code" followed by the content of the response to the file.
    # The content is assumed to come from a response object, which is not defined here.
    file.write("## Final Code \n\n" + response.content + "\n")
``` 

This block of code opens a file named `test_output.md` in append mode (`"a"`), ensuring it doesn't overwrite the existing content. It then writes a formatted string to the file, which includes a markdown header "## Final Code" followed by the content of a response object. The encoding is set to "utf-8" to support a wide range of characters.
